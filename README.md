# Martian Splendour

Website showcasing an elite fictional resort on Mars. The site is primarily HTML and CSS an was created to flex my creative abilities and design skills. Javascript was utilised in the making of the random fact generator which can be found at the bottom of the home page. Additionally, it was used in hand-crafted carousel/light-box used in the "Gallery" page. Finally, it was used for some form validation in the "Booking" page.
